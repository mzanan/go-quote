                                In General. We may collect personal information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address, as well as other information that does not identify you such as gender and date of birth. When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to MassNexus servers located in the United States and other countries around the world. <br><br>Information You Provide. We may collect your username and password and any personal or company information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner. This may include identifying information about you or your employer or company (such as your name, company name, address, e-mail address, telephone numbers, fax number, Social Security Number, Employer or Tax Identification Number, driver's license number, jurisdiction of incorporation, address and/or telephone number), information about your or your company’s references (such as name and telephone number), information you provide when completing a survey, and credit or debit card, PayPal or other payment account information, including valid credit card number, type and expiration date. If you are a MassNexus advertiser or publisher, we also collect information about advertising or lead generation campaigns you conduct or participate in using our website or services, such as web traffic and activity information, campaign results and information you enter into our dashboard or other account interface. We may also track your interaction with email advertisements sent to you by MassNexus or our e-mail service providers on our behalf (for example, when you register, purchase, or browse in response to such emails). 
                                <br><br>List Information from Vendors. We may obtain information about you after you provide information to a third party and you permit that party (the "Seller") to share the information, which MassNexus subsequently purchases, licenses or otherwise lawfully acquires. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, company name, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth date, gender, salary range, education, marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and/or online interests, and/or other information which you provided to the Seller (together, "Vendor List Information"). When acquiring Vendor List Information, MassNexus requires assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Vendor List Information to MassNexus and that MassNexus may lawfully use the Vendor List Information to transmit offers to you. You may opt out of receiving these offers by using one of the methods specified in the section below entitled “Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your information”. 
                                <br><br>Information from Other Sources.

We and these companies may automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our website. This information may include your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us or them (see "Cookies" below) and the referring website address.

                                When you visit our website, we may assign your computer one or more cookies, to facilitate access to our website, to personalize your online experience, and to record information about your visit to our website. A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows your computer's browser to store your preferences and allows MassNexus, our authorized service providers, advertising companies and ad networks to identify you by a unique identifier and associate this with corresponding information in our or their database. Through the use of a cookie, we and these companies may store your non-personally identifiable registration information and user preferences and may also automatically collect information about your online activity on our website, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while on our website. In addition, MassNexus may set a cookie on your computer when you view our advertisements delivered on or in connection with a third-party website you are visiting. After a cookie is set, MassNexus may track how you interact with the advertisement (for example, registering, purchasing, browsing, etc.). Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our website. We do not tie tracking cookies used for behavioral or targeted advertising purposes to any personal information you submit while on our site; however, cookies may be tied to your personal application information solely for purposes of effectuating transactions you have requested and similar purposes related to the operation of our website (such as managing our relationships with websites from which you may have been referred to us). They do NOT, however, collect personal information. Although we may place or allow third parties to place their cookies when you visit our website (as described more fully in the subsection below entitled “Targeted or Behavioral Advertising”), we do not have access or control over third party cookies nor does our privacy policy cover the use of cookies by third parties.

                                We may use other standard Internet activity tracking technologies, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use on our website or your interaction with our advertisements. A web beacon is a programming code used to display an image on a web page and can also transfer an individual's user identification to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about the individual. Such information may be used in targeted or behavioral advertising, as well as for the other uses described in this paragraph. We may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters or online advertisements to determine whether messages have been opened or acted upon. We may use the information we obtain in this manner to customize the services and offers we provide our website visitors, to deliver targeted advertisements, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities. We do not tie web beacons to any personal information you submit while on our website.

                                Targeted advertising (also known as behavioral advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing behavior such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which MassNexus advertisement should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than this website. For example, if you have shown a preference for a certain product while visiting this website site, you may be served an advertisement from or about this site for the same or a similar product when you visit a site other than the MassNexus site. The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number. The information used for targeted advertising either comes from this website or through third party website publishers. 
                            <br><br>In addition, we may place (or allow third parties to place) cookies and pixels on our website which enable our authorized service providers, advertising companies and advertising networks to collect information about our users who view or interact with their or our advertisements on our website or complete certain actions on our site, such as submitting an application or registration form. However, we do not tie these cookies and pixels to personal information that you submit on our website. The information collected by the cookies and pixels allows us and the companies mentioned above to deliver, and gauge the effectiveness of, targeted advertisements, both on our site and when you are browsing other websites. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org), which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.

                                We may store the personal information described above as necessary to accomplish the business purposes for which it was collected, as well as to comply with our legal and audit obligations, resolve reported and potential disputes, and enforce our agreements. For example, we may store information as long as your account is active; since users’ payment accounts may be charged for recurring fees, we may store your account information so that you do not have to re-enter this information. However, we do NOT store highly sensitive information such as Social Security numbers for extended periods of time or any longer than necessary for authentication and similar requirements and other legitimate business purposes. We also maintain an information security program that limits storage of personal information to what is needed to fulfill our reasonable business, legal and audit requirements.

                                If you would like to delete the personal information that we have collected from you, please send your request via e-mail to privacy@MassNexus.com. We will process your request, where possible and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy, within a reasonable period of time after receipt. However, federal and state regulations and/or the need to administer our relationships with our ad networks and other third parties may require that we store certain information for various periods of time. In order to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to delete your information from our database until the expiration of the applicable period. However, we will use reasonable commercial efforts to delete your personal information no later than three (3) months after receiving your request, unless a longer retention period is required by law. Please also be aware that if you request us to delete your personal information, your request will apply only to information held by us and not to information we have already shared with third parties; the treatment of such information held by third parties is governed by those parties’ privacy policies, not by this Privacy Policy. When you initially sign up or submit information on our website, you will receive e-mail messages or newsletters from us. You will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. You may also opt out of receiving commercial e-mails by using the "unsubscribe" link on our website. It may take up to 10 business days for us to fully process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as requests for additional information, confirmations, service updates or announcements, administrative notices and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that opting out of receipt of commercial e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.

                                We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, with regard to MassNexus’ internal operations, only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. We use a reputable security service provider to manage our servers on which your personal information is stored. In addition, personal information you submit to MassNexus through our website is transmitted through an encrypted SSL (secure socket layer technology) connection, and MassNexus’ computers and networks have security measures, such as firewalls, to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of the information under MassNexus’ control.

Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care how they handle and disclose their personal information.
